Simple Regression Models

This repository contains beginner-friendly implementations of common regression algorithms using Python and scikit-learn. Each model includes clean, well-commented code to help you understand how regression works in practice.

📌 Models Included
1. Linear Regression

A basic regression technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a straight line.

Fits y = mx + b

Fast and interpretable

Useful for linearly separable trends

2. Polynomial Regression

An extension of linear regression that models non-linear relationships by adding polynomial features.

Fits curves like quadratic, cubic, etc.

Great for curved patterns in data

3. Boosting Regression

Implementation using algorithms such as:

Gradient Boosting Regressor

AdaBoost Regressor

XGBoost Regressor (if installed)

Boosting combines many weak learners to create a powerful model.
It handles complex patterns very well.
